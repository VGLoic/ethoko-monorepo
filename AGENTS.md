# Agent Guidelines for Ethoko Monorepo

Guidelines for AI coding agents working in the Ethoko monorepo.

## Project Overview

Ethoko is a warehouse for smart-contract compilation artifacts. It enables teams to version, store, and share smart-contract compilation artifacts, decoupling compilation from operation.
**Monorepo Structure:**

- `packages/cli-beacon`: Standalone CLI for Ethoko artifact management (main package)
- `apps/*`: Integration examples with different frameworks (e.g., Foundry and Hardhat)

## Documentation

CLI delivery strategy overview: `docs/CLI_DELIVERY.md`
Configuration strategy overview: `docs/CONFIG.md`
cli-beacon code style guideline: `docs/CLI_BEACON_CODE_STYLE_GUIDELINE.md`

## Build System

**Package Manager:** pnpm 9.0.0 (required)
**Build Tool:** Turborepo
**Node Version:** `nvm use`

## Test

### E2E Test Pattern for `@ethoko/cli-beacon`

**Test Framework:** Vitest with global setup, 60s timeout, located in `test/**/*.e2e.test.ts`.

**Key Points:**

- All tests automatically run against both filesystem and S3 (LocalStack) providers
- Fixtures (`storageProvider`, `pulledArtifactStore`) are auto-setup and auto-cleaned
- No manual `beforeEach`/`afterEach` needed
- Use `storageProviderTest.for()` instead of `describe.each()` for parameterized tests
- Always use `as const` on test data arrays for better type inference

### E2E Test Pattern for integration apps in `apps/`

**Test Framework:** Vitest with global setup, 60s timeout, located in `e2e-test/*.e2e.test.ts`.

**Key Points:**

- All tests run with the filesystem provider.
- All tests use the same `setup.ts`, `compilation-targets.ts` and `helpers/` for utilites.

## Validation Workflow

**Critical:** Run this validation suite after completing each logical unit of work (feature, bug fix, todo item).

### Steps (run at root level in order)

1. **`pnpm build`** - Build all packages (Turborepo handles dependency order)
2. **`pnpm check-types`** - Typecheck all packages
3. **`pnpm lint`** - Lint all packages (max 0 warnings)
4. **`pnpm format`** - Format all packages
5. **`pnpm test:e2e:core`** - Run all E2E tests for `@ethoko/cli-beacon`
6. **`pnpm test:e2e:apps`** - Run all E2E tests for integration apps

### Failure Handling

If any check fails, **immediately fix the issue** before proceeding with additional work.

### Key Notes

- **When to Run:** After completing a logical unit of work, not after every single file edit.
- **Root-Level Execution:** Always run these commands at the monorepo root to validate all packages.

```

## Git Workflow

- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive
- Run the complete validation workflow (see "Validation Workflow" section) before committing

## Plan Mode

When creating multi-step plans:

- Keep plans extremely concise - sacrifice grammar for brevity
- End each plan with unresolved questions (if any)
