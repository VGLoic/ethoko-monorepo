# Hardhat Ethoko - Example - Deploy Counter

This is an example of integration between [Hardhat V3](https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started) and [Ethoko](https://github.com/VGLoic/ethoko-monorepo).

The [Hardhat-Deploy](https://rocketh.dev/hardhat-deploy/) (`hardhat-deploy@2.0.0-next.76` i.e. `v2`) plugin is used to manage deployments.

## Workflow

### Content

In this example, we implement a a simple `Counter` contract, see [Counter.sol](./artifacts/Counter.sol).

### Development phase

Development is done as usual, with as many tests or else.

### Release phase

Once the development is considered done, one can create the compilation artifacts:

```bash
npx hardhat build --build-profile production
```

The compilation artifacts will be pushed to `Ethoko`, hence freezing them for later use.

```bash
# The tag 2026-02-02 is arbitrary, it can be any string identifying the release
npx hardhat ethoko push --tag 2026-02-02
```

### Deployment phase

Later on, the same developper or another one wants to deploy the contracts for the `2026-02-02` release.
It will first pull the compilation artifacts from `Ethoko`:

```bash
npx hardhat ethoko pull
```

Then, generates the typings in order to write a type-safe deployment script:

```bash
npx hardhat ethoko typings
```

Finally, the deployer can write a deployment script, e.g. [00-deploy-counter-2026-02-02.ts](./deploy/deploy_counter-2026-02-02.ts), that will retrieve the compilation artifacts from `Ethoko` and deploy the contract accordingly.

```ts
import { deployScript } from "../rocketh/deploy.js";
import {
  ContractArtifact as EthokoContractArtifact,
  project,
} from "../.ethoko-typings";
import * as RockethTypes from "rocketh/types";

const TARGET_RELEASE_TAG = "2026-02-02";

export default deployScript(
  async ({ deploy, namedAccounts }) => {
    const { deployer } = namedAccounts;

    const projectUtils = project("curious-counter");

    const counterArtifact = await projectUtils
      .tag(TARGET_RELEASE_TAG)
      .getContractArtifact("project/contracts/Counter.sol:Counter");

    await deploy(`Counter@${TARGET_RELEASE_TAG}`, {
      account: deployer,
      // Ethoko still needs refinement on types
      // we use a dedicated function to cast to expected Rocketh's type
      artifact: toRockethArtifact(counterArtifact),
    });
  },
  { tags: ["Counter", "Counter_deploy", TARGET_RELEASE_TAG] },
);

function toRockethArtifact(
  artifact: EthokoContractArtifact,
): RockethTypes.Artifact {
  return {
    abi: artifact.abi as RockethTypes.Abi,
    bytecode: artifact.bytecode,
    metadata: artifact.metadata,
    // | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
    // | | | Optional fields | | |
    // v v v                 v v v
    deployedBytecode: artifact.deployedBytecode,
    linkReferences: artifact.linkReferences,
    deployedLinkReferences: artifact.deployedLinkReferences,
    contractName: artifact.contractName,
    sourceName: artifact.sourceName,
    devdoc: artifact.devdoc as RockethTypes.DevDoc | undefined,
    evm: artifact.evm,
    storageLayout: artifact.storageLayout as
      | RockethTypes.StorageLayout
      | undefined,
    userdoc: artifact.userdoc as RockethTypes.UserDoc | undefined,
  };
}
```

The deployment script can be executed using the Hardhat-Deploy plugin:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network <network-name>
```

No additional compilation step is needed since the deployment script directly uses the static artifacts from `Ethoko`.

The deployment is by nature idempotent, this is guaranteed by the fact that the used artifacts are static and the Hardhat-Deploy plugin.
