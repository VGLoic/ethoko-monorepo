## What is Ethoko?

Ethoko enables teams to **store** and **share** versionned smart-contract compilation artifacts.  
As such, it decouples the compilation process from the operation processes.

Define the storage backend of your choice, push your compilation artifacts to Ethoko and pull them back when you need them, in a safe and transparent way.

Ethoko supports both Hardhat and Foundry development environments, compile once, operates safely.

## CLI

Ethoko ships as a standalone CLI.

### Install

The easiest way to install the Ethoko CLI is to through the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.ethoko.com | bash
```

Alternatively, Ethoko can be installed globally or locally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @ethoko/cli
npm install --save-dev @ethoko/cli
```

### Configuration

Ethoko CLI manages various `projects`, each of them storing their dedicated compilation artifacts in a `storage` backend. Two types of storage backends are currently supported:
- `aws`: store the compilation artifacts in an AWS S3 bucket. The bucket must be created beforehand, and the AWS credentials must be configured locally for Ethoko to be able to access it.
- `filesystem`: store the compilation artifacts locally in the specified directory.

Ethoko CLI can be configured either using the global configuration file at `~/.ethoko/config.json` or using a local configuration file `ethoko.config.json` at the root of your repository. The local configuration file will override the global one if both are present.

For a quick guided setup, it is recommended to use the init command:
```bash
ethoko init
```

Generally, the global configuration file will define the projects
```json
// Global ~/.ethoko/config.json: defines global projects
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "storage": {
        "type": "aws",
        "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
        "awsBucketName": "my-artifacts-bucket",
        "awsProfile": "my-profile"
      }
    }
  ],
}
```

While the local configuration file will refine the configuration for a specific project or specify local project hosted directly in the directory:

```json
// Local ethoko.config.json: 
{
  "compilationOutputPath": "./artifacts"
}
```

Check out the full [configuration reference in the docs](docs/external/CONFIGURATION.md).

### Projects, tags and IDs

A developer will interact with a list of **projects**, e.g. `my-project`, each of them gathering many compilation artifacts. A project is defined by its name and storage backend.

Each artifact is uniquely identified by its **ID**, e.g. `b5e41181986a`, which is the hash of the compilation artifact content. The ID is automatically generated when pushing an artifact to Ethoko and can be used to retrieve it later.

Finally, a **tag**, e.g. `2026-02-02` or `v1.2.3`, can be associated to a compilation artifact when pushed.

### Commands

Run `ethoko --help` for a full list of available commands and options. Use the `--help` flag with any command to get more details about its usage, e.g. `ethoko push --help`.

#### Push

Push a local compilation artifact for the configured project, creating the remote artifact with its ID and optionally tagging it.

Only push the compilation artifact without an additional tag:

```bash
ethoko push my-project
```

Or use a tag to associate the compilation artifact with it

```bash
ethoko push my-project:2026-02-02
```

If not setup in the local configuration with `compilationOutputPath` or need to be overriden, the path to the compilation artifact can be provided

```bash
# e.g. ./artifacts for Hardhat, ./out for Foundry, etc...
ethoko push my-project --artifact-path ./path/to/artifacts
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ethoko will try to read the compilation artifact from the configured or provided path. If multiple choices are possible, it will ask the user to select one of them. One can avoid this prompt by providing the full path to the compilation artifact or ensure there is only one compilation artifact in the provided path.

#### Pull

Pull locally the missing artifacts for a configured project.

One can pull all the artifacts from a project

```bash
ethoko pull my-project
```

Or target a specific artifact using its tag or ID:

```bash
ethoko pull my-project@b5e41181986a
ethoko pull my-project:2026-02-02
```

#### Export

Export a contract artifact from a locally pulled artifact.

```bash
# Using only the contract name, case insensitive, will fail if multiple contracts with the same name are found
ethoko export my-project:2026-02-02 --contract Counter
# Using the fully qualified path to the contract, case sensitive, will avoid any ambiguity
ethoko export my-project@b5e41181986a --contract contracts/Counter.sol:Counter
```

Write the contract artifact to a file (overwrites if it exists):

```bash
ethoko export my-project:2026-02-02 --contract Counter --output ./Counter.json
```

Pipe the artifact to another tool:

```bash
ethoko export my-project:2026-02-02 --contract Counter | jq
```

Export the ABI as a TypeScript `const`:

```bash
echo "export const MY_ABI = $(ethoko export my-project:2026-02-02 --contract Counter | jq .abi) as const;" > ./my-abi.ts
```

#### Typings

Once the artifacts have been pulled, one can generate the TypeScript typings based on the pulled projects.

```bash
ethoko typings
```

> [!NOTE]
> If no projects have been pulled, one can still generate the default typings using this command. It may be helpful for those who do not care about the scripts involving Ethoko but want to be unblocked in case of missing files.

#### List artifacts

List the pulled compilation artifacts with their project.

```bash
ethoko artifacts
```

#### Inspect

Inspect a pulled compilation artifact to list contracts and metadata.

```bash
ethoko inspect my-project:2026-02-02
ethoko inspect my-project@b5e41181986a
```

Output JSON for scripting:

```bash
ethoko inspect my-project:2026-02-02 --json
```

#### Config

Display the effective configuration — the result of merging the global and local config files. Useful to verify which projects are available and where values come from.

```bash
ethoko config
```

Each project is labelled with its source: `[global]`, `[local]`, or `[local - overrides global]` when both configs define the same project name.

#### Init

Initialize the Ethoko configuration through an interactive wizard. It guides you through:

- Adding projects (name, storage backend, and whether to store the config globally or locally)
- Detecting and setting the compilation output path (`./artifacts` for Hardhat, `./out` for Foundry)
- Adding the relevant paths to `.gitignore`

```bash
ethoko init
```

If you need to add another project or change the local config file path:

```bash
ethoko init --config ./path/to/ethoko.config.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running `ethoko init` again will let you add more projects to an existing configuration without overwriting it.

#### Restore

Original compilation artifacts are never lost and can be restored from a locally pulled artifact to a local directory.

```bash
ethoko restore my-project@b5e41181986a --output ./restored
ethoko restore my-project:2026-02-02 --output ./restored
```

> [!NOTE]
> The artifact must be pulled locally before restoring, and the output directory must be empty unless the `--force` flag is used.

#### Diff

Compare a local compilation artifacts with an existing compilation artifact and print the contracts for which differences have been found.

```bash
ethoko diff my-project:2026-02-02

ethoko diff my-project@b5e41181986a
```

If not setup in the configuration or need to be overriden, the path to the compilation artifact can be provided

```bash
# e.g. ./artifacts for Hardhat, ./out for Foundry, etc...
ethoko diff my-project:2026-02-02 --artifact-path ./path/to/artifacts
```

### Using the exported artifacts in scripts

The exported artifacts can be used as any JSON files in scripts for various purposes, e.g. deployment, verification, etc... Adapt the example below to your own deployment tooling.

Below is an example of a deployment script with the [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) plugin for deploying a released smart contract.

```ts
import { deployScript } from "../rocketh/deploy.js";
import CounterArtifact from "../releases/2026-02-04/counter.json";
import type * as RockethTypes from "rocketh/types";

export default deployScript(
  async ({ deploy, namedAccounts }) => {
    const { deployer } = namedAccounts;

    await deploy(`Counter@2026-02-04`, {
      account: deployer,
      artifact: {
        abi: CounterArtifact.abi as RockethTypes.Abi,
        bytecode: CounterArtifact.bytecode,
        metadata: CounterArtifact.metadata,
      },
    });
  },
  { tags: ["Counter", "Counter_deploy", "2026-02-04"] },
);
```

### Using the typings in a Typescript environment

The typings are exposed in order to help the developer retrieve easily and safely a contract artifact (ABI, bytecode, etc...).

The same deployment script as above can be rewritten using the generated typings:

```ts
import { deployScript } from "../rocketh/deploy.js";
import { project } from "../.ethoko-typings";

export default deployScript(
  async ({ deploy, namedAccounts }) => {
    const { deployer } = namedAccounts;

    const counterArtifact = await project("doubtful-project")
      .tag("2026-02-04")
      .getContractArtifact("src/Counter.sol:Counter");

    await deploy(`Counter@2026-02-04`, {
      account: deployer,
      artifact: {
        abi: counterArtifact.abi,
        bytecode: counterArtifact.bytecode,
        metadata: counterArtifact.metadata,
      },
    });
  },
  { tags: ["Counter", "Counter_deploy", "2026-02-04"] },
);
```

If typings have been generated from existing projects, the inputs of the utils will be strongly typed and wrong project, tags or contracts names will be detected.

In case there are no projects or the projects have not been pulled, the generated typings are made in such a way that strong typecheck disappears and any string can be used with the helper functions.

#### Retrieve input and outputs compilation artifacts

The input and contract outputs compilation artifacts of a tag can be retrieved using the `project("doubtful-project").tag("2026-02-02").{getInputCompilationArtifact, getContractOutputCompilationArtifact}` methods.

The input compilation artifact contains the sources and settings used for compilation. There is one output compilation artifact per contract, each containing the ABI, bytecode and metadata for the contract.
